## Setup

Type `!setup` to add your server to my database. From there you should set tell me what roles can edit my settings by using `!addrole :role`.

## Stream Alerts

I will always announce everyone in the server when they go live. Just set which channel to announce to by going to that channel and typing `!setlog`.

## Commands

### Administrative

These commands will check to see if the user's role is part of the administrative ones you provided. If none were provided, ANYONE can use these, so be careful!
